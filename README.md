# Electricity Network Optimization Visualization

**Project Level**: Intermediate  
**Dataset**: Created by ChatGPT

This project involves developing a **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes the costs and performance metrics of optimizing an electricity network. It aims to provide an overview of section-wise expenses, equipment costs, and trends over time, helping to make data-driven decisions regarding network optimization.

## üìä Project Objectives

- **Track Total Costs**: Monitor the total estimated cost of optimizing the electricity network.
- **Analyze Section-wise Expenses**: Visualize costs for each section (A, B, C, D, and E), categorized by Maintenance, Refurbishment, Replacement, and Upgrade.
- **Visualize Equipment Cost Breakdown**: Understand how different equipment types contribute to overall costs (e.g., Transformers, Switchgear, Cables).
- **Monitor Cost Trends Over Time**: Identify peak spending periods through a time-based analysis of expenses from January 2023 to May 2024.

## üöÄ Key Features

1. **Total Estimated Cost**  
   - Total project cost: **13 million**.

2. **Equipment Breakdown**  
   - Breakdown of costs by equipment type:
     - **Transformers**: 23.47%
     - **Switchgear**: 20.62%
     - **Cables**: 19.18%
     - **Circuit Breakers**: 18.4%
     - **Insulators**: 18.25%

3. **Section-wise Expense Summary**  
   - Sections A‚ÄìE are analyzed for the following expense categories:
     - **Maintenance**
     - **Refurbishment**
     - **Replacement**
     - **Upgrade**
   - Example: **Section A** shows high refurbishment costs, while **Section D** has significant upgrade expenses.

4. **Valuation Summary**  
   - A bar chart comparing total costs for each section:
     - **Section B**: Highest overall cost at **3 million**.
     - **Section C**: Lowest total valuation at **2.2 million**.

5. **Cost Over Time**  
   - A line chart showing cost evolution from **January 2023** to **May 2024**.
     - Highest cost: **0.93 million** in **March 2024**.
     - Lowest cost: **0.43 million** in **May 2024**.

## üí° Insights

- **Transformers** account for the largest share of equipment costs (23.47%), followed by **Switchgear**.
- **Section B** has the highest overall cost, driven by high **maintenance** and **replacement** expenses.
- A noticeable cost spike occurs in **March 2024**, followed by a significant drop in **May 2024**.
- **Section D** has high upgrade costs, indicating potential for major network improvements in that section.

## üìà Conclusion

The dashboard serves as a powerful tool to visualize and analyze the financial aspects of the electricity network optimization project. It offers clear insights into cost distribution across different sections and equipment while helping track spending trends over time. 

This project provides actionable insights to support decision-making for future network upgrades and optimization.
